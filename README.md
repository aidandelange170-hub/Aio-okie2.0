# Complex Multi-Language IDE

A sophisticated code editor built with C++ that supports multiple programming languages with a modern UI similar to Visual Studio Code.

## Features

- **Multi-Language Support**: Supports 8 programming languages:
  - C++
  - Python
  - JavaScript
  - Java
  - C#
  - Ruby
  - PHP
  - Go

- **Modern UI**: Interface designed to resemble Visual Studio Code with:
  - File explorer panel
  - Code editor area
  - Menu and toolbar
  - Status bar
  - Syntax highlighting

- **Core Functionality**:
  - File creation and editing
  - Syntax highlighting for all supported languages
  - File saving and loading
  - Language detection

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++17 compatible compiler
- CMake 3.10 or higher
- Make

### Building the Project

```bash
# Clone or navigate to the project directory
cd /workspace

# Build the project
cmake .
make
```

### Running the IDE

Use the start-now script to launch the application:

```bash
./start-now
```

Or run directly:
```bash
./build/ide_app
```

## Architecture

The IDE is built with a modular architecture:

- `TextEditor`: Core editor functionality
- `LanguageManager`: Handles language-specific features
- `EditorUI`: Modern UI components similar to VS Code
- `IDEApp`: Main application class

## Languages Supported

Each language includes:
- Syntax highlighting
- Keyword recognition
- File extension association
- Color coding

## Usage

The IDE provides a VS Code-like experience with:
- File explorer on the left
- Main code editing area
- Status bar at the bottom
- Menu and toolbar for actions

## Google Colab Version

For running this IDE in Google Colab, we've created a web-based version with the same features as the desktop GUI version.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Run in Google Colab:

1. **Open Google Colab**
   - Go to [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com)
   - Create a new notebook

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```python
   !pip install flask
   ```

3. **Clone the Repository**
   ```python
   !git clone https://github.com/your-username/complex-multi-language-ide.git
   %cd complex-multi-language-ide
   ```

4. **Navigate to Web Version**
   ```python
   %cd web
   ```

5. **Install Web Dependencies**
   ```python
   !pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. **Run the Web IDE**
   ```python
   %%writefile app_runner.py
   import subprocess
   import time
   import threading
   from flask_ngrok import run_with_ngrok
   from app import app
   
   if __name__ == '__main__':
       run_with_ngrok(app)
       app.run()
   ```

7. **Install ngrok for external access**
   ```python
   !pip install flask-ngrok
   ```

8. **Start the Application**
   ```python
   !python app_runner.py
   ```

9. **Access the IDE**
   - After starting, you'll see a public URL generated by ngrok
   - Open this URL in a new browser tab to access the web-based IDE
   - The interface will look similar to the desktop version with:
     - File explorer panel
     - Code editor area
     - Menu and toolbar
     - Status bar
     - Output panel
     - Syntax highlighting for all supported languages

### Features Available in Web Version:

- **Multi-Language Support**: Same 8 programming languages as the desktop version
- **Code Execution**: Run code in Python, JavaScript, C++, Java, C#, Ruby, PHP, and Go
- **File Operations**: Save and load files
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Full syntax highlighting for all supported languages
- **VS Code-like UI**: Similar interface with file explorer, editor, and output panels
- **Real-time Output**: See execution results in the output panel
